# Human-Gene-Function-Prediction
This project was done in my Bioinformatics class for predicting human gene annotation from  human gene cancer cell lines. Our approach achieved best ROC-AUC on all submissions. Check [Human_Gene_Function_Prediction.pdf](./Report/Human_Gene_Function_Prediction.pdf) for project report.

[NN+Stacking.ipynb](./NN+Stacking.ipynb) and [RandomForest.ipynb](./RandomForest.ipynb) are notebooks for running Multi-Layers Perceptron, Stacking and RandomForest.
[GO_Term_Separate20.py](./GO_Term_Separate20.py) is the file for calculating easiest and hardest to predict Gene Annotations.
